#  Simple Network Filter Implementation
This is a simple implement of using iptable to protect http server from flooding.<br>
Enviroment: Docker Container, server is ngnix.<br>
The entire process of using the filter is not automatic and needs to be done manually step by step.<br>
Sorry for the lack of code comments<br><br>
